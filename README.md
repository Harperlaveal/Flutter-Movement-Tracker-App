# Assignment 3 - Flutter App

## Setting up the development enviroment

For this assignment I used the Flutter framework.

Below are steps which need to be followed in order to run the app which I have developed.

1. Visit this link https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install to download the zip file for flutter for your specifc operating system.

2. After doing this extract the file in the desired location.

3. Add the Flutter tool to your path with the following command
    **export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"**

4. Run **flutter doctor** in the terminal to see if there are any dependencies which need to be downloaded

5. Install XCode from the Mac app store. And then run the following in the terminal
    **sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
    sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch**


6. **cd ass3** 

7. **flutter run** to run the application.
